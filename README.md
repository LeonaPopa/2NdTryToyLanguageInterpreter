# Toy Language Interpreter - University Project

## Overview

This project is a Toy Language Interpreter developed as a university project. It interprets a simple toy language and demonstrates fundamental concepts of language parsing and interpretation.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Java project structure with the following main components:

- **src**: Contains the source code of the project.
  - **controller**: Includes the controller logic for the interpreter.
  - **model**: Contains the data models used in the project.
  - **repository**: Manages the data persistence and storage.
  - **view**: Handles the user interface and interaction.

## Directory Contents

- **.gitattributes**: Git attributes file.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files to be ignored by git.
- **.idea**: Contains IDE specific settings.
- **Try2ForTLI.iml**: IntelliJ IDEA project file.
- **log1.txt**, **log8.txt**: Log files for the project.
- **src**: Main source directory containing the following packages:
  - **controller**: `Controller.java` - Main controller logic.
  - **model**: Data models (files not listed).
  - **repository**: Data repository logic (files not listed).
  - **view**: User interface components (files not listed).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Open the project in your IDE**:
   - If using IntelliJ IDEA, open the `Try2ForTLI.iml` file.

3. **Build the project**:
   - In your IDE, build the project to download dependencies and compile the source code.

### Running the Interpreter

1. **Run the main application**:
   - Locate the main class in the `controller` package and run it. This will start the Toy Language Interpreter.

### Logging

- Log files (`log1.txt`, `log8.txt`) are used to track the execution and debug the application.

## Usage

Once the interpreter is running, you can input commands in the toy language syntax, and the interpreter will process them and display the results.
